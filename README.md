# Vaadin Framework

*[Vaadin](https://vaadin.com) allows you to build modern web apps efficiently in plain Java, without touching low level web technologies.*

This repository contains source code and issue tracking for Vaadin 8 and Vaadin 7, both of which use GWT as the base of client-side implementations. You can find source code and issue tracking for newer, web component based Vaadin versions in [vaadin/platform](https://github.com/vaadin/platform).
